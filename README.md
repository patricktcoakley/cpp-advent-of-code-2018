# Advent of Code 2018 (C++)

This repo contains solutions from the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018/) written in C++ using 
CMake; I try to use modern C++ features and the STL when possible. The solutions to all the answers will be printed 
out using standard output when running 'main.cpp'. I will also attempt to update or optimize solutions in the future
 should I think of it.
